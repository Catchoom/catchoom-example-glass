## Catchoom CraftAR - Google Glass SDK examples

### Introduction

Catchoom allows to create recognition only experiences using the 
Catchoom CraftAR Service and its SDK for Google Glass.

With Catchoom, you can create amazing apps that provide digital content
for real-life objects like printed media, packaging among others. You
can use our online web panel or APIs, to upload images to be recognized and set 
contents to display upon recognition in your Catchoom-powered Glass app.

This project contains a simple example showing how to perform image recognition on
your Google Glass using the Catchoom SDK for Google Glass.
